# HR-Analytics
HR analytics project focused on gathering data from various sources, including Excel, followed by meticulous transformation using Power Query in Power BI. The primary objective was to create meaningful measures using DAX analytics  and deliver interactive dashboard.
Working with HR analytics involves identifying what to measure, selecting key performance indicators (KPIs) and using the resulting analysis to make data-informed decisions. Comparing your findings with industry data can help you benchmark your own performance and better understand HR trends.
